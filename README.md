# Adaptive Multi-Layer Agent Simulation
Simulation code for adaptive multi-layer agent experiments

This repository contains C implementations of simulation experiments
used to study adaptive behavior, path dependence, feedback stabilization,
and emergent dynamics in learning agents.

The simulations accompany an academic manuscript investigating how
layered feedback architectures influence robustness and differentiation
in adaptive systems.

## Requirements

- Any standard C compiler (gcc, clang, or online C compiler)

---

## How to Run

1. Open any online C compiler or local compiler.
2. Copy the code from any experiment file.
3. Compile and run.
4. Observe printed outputs in the console.

---

## Experiments

- experiment1.c  
  Perception bias and decision variability.

- experiment2.c  
  Learning dynamics and path dependence.

- experiment3.c  
  Meta-feedback (observer) stabilization effects.

- experiment4.c  
  Multi-agent social interaction dynamics.

- experiment5.c  
  Emotion, memory decay, and robustness behavior.

## Reproducibility

All experiments are stochastic. Multiple runs are recommended to observe
robust statistical patterns.
